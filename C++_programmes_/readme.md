# Getting started with C++?

* These are the programs that will help you to get started with C++

### Why you should consider these?

* So, you don't know where to start & you just want to try it.

* Then, these programs may be helpful to you as they `consist` of some explanation which is going to help you (commented-out) and I wrote why one should `use something` and what is their `functioning`. 

* The best part is that these series or repo will gonna be updated frequently so you get to know something `new` whenever you visit this repo/folder.

* I also uploaded some medium level program mean that some program or thing might be confusing to you right now but when you do them consistently and going to practice by making different programs then they will be really easy to understand (but I also tried my best to explain what something does when I thought it might be confusing or new to someone).

### What if you find some other ways to do the same thing?

* Then please consider sending a pull request to this repo section with the explanation of why you think it's better or easier to do or just send a pull request so I can add it because there is no harm in learning new ways to do a thing. 

* Then, I am gonna check it and will definitely update the files if I found no errors in the program (always test your program before sending and try to reduce as many errors as you can) we are here to improve and `Help each other. 

## You can also check my 'Youtube channel' for a better understanding.

* You should also check my `Youtube Channel` there I uploaded videos on some basic concepts of C++ (sorry they are in Hindi), let me know if you want subtitles on the videos I will add them [VS Techz](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS5Y6YXkErZPmOYZIV3I_0A).

* If for some reason I didn't check it or reply to you then you can `directly message` me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/pranavgoel_29).
